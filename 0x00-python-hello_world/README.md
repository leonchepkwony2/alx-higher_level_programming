# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about  introduction to Python for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
