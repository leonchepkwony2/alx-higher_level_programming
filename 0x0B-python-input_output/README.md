# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about  Input/Output in  Python for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* How to open a file
* How to write text in a file
* How to read the full content of a file
* How to read a file line by line
* How to move the cursor in a file
* How to make sure a file is closed after using it
* What is and how to use the with statement
* What is JSON
* What is serialization
* What is deserialization
* How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
* How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a newline character
* The first line of all your script files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Python Test Cases

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project about Input/Output in  Python was completed as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Program.
