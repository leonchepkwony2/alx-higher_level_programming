# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about  objects in  Python for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a newline character
* The first line of all your script files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## *.txt* Answer Files
  * Only one line
  * No Shebang
  * All your files should end with a new line
