# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about  Test-driven development in  Python for the Holberton School curriculum.

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What’s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases


## Resources

* <a href= "https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html">doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)</a>
* <a href= "https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/">doctest – Testing through documentation</a>

* <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfv5tUGsn8">Unit Tests in Python</a>
* <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI">Unittest module</a>
* <a href= "https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">https://mattermost.com/blog/testing-python-understanding-doctest-and-unittest/</a>


## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a newline character
* The first line of all your script files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Python Test Cases

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project about Test-driven development in  Python was completed as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Program.
